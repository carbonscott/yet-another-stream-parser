## Crystel's Processing Scripts

Crystfel's stream file processing script in `externals/crystfel/libcrystfel/src/stream.c` and `externals/crystfel/libcrystfel/src/stream.h`.

## Python Environment

Run python programs with `uv`.

`uv` cache is at `UV_CACHE_DIR=/sdf/data/lcls/ds/prj/prjdat21/results/cwang31/.UV_CACHE`

## Test Data

Sample stream file for testing:
```
/sdf/data/lcls/ds/mfx/mfxl1025422/results/btx/streams/ox112it2.stream  # roughly 40GB in size
/sdf/data/lcls/ds/cxi/cxil1015922/results/Quentin/b2/day3_4/stream_r0136/full.stream  $ roughly 5GB in size
```
